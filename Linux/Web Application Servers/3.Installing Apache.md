You’ll setup your web application server one piece at a time, testing each as you progress. The first step is to get your server responding to HTTP requests. To do this, you’ll use Apache HTTP Server - the most commonly installed web server on the Internet with roughly 47% market share.

Install Apache using your package manager with the following command: `sudo apt-get install apache2` Confirm Apache is working by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your browser. You should see the following page:

Default Ubuntu Start Page

Apache, by default, serves its files from the `/var/www/html` directory. If you explore this directory you will find a file called `index.html` and if you review that file you will see it contains the HTML of the page you see when you visit http://localhost:8080.

Exercise
Update the index.html to simply display “Hello, World!” and refresh your browser to see your new page.
