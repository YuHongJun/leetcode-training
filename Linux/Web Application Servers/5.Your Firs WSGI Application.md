[WSGI](http://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications.
 Most if not all Python web frameworks are WSGI compliant, including [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/deploying/mod_wsgi/) and [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/deployment/wsgi/); but to quickly test if you have your Apache configuration correct youâ€™ll write a very basic WSGI application.

You just defined the name of the file you need to write within your Apache configuration by using the `WSGIScriptAlias` directive. Despite having the extension `.wsgi`, these are just Python applications.
 Create the `/var/www/html/myapp.wsgi` file using the command `sudo nano /var/www/html/myapp.wsgi`. Within this file, write the following application:
```
def application(environ, start_response):
    status = '200 OK'
    output = 'Hello World!'

    response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain'), ('Content-Length', str(len(output)))]
    start_response(status, response_headers)

    return [output]
```
This application will simply print return `Hello World!`
along with the required HTTP response headers. After saving this file you can reload http://localhost:8080 to see your application run in all its glory!
