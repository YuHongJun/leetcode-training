When Apache receives a request it has a number of ways it can respond. What you’ve seen thus far is the simplest method of operation, Apache just returns a file requested or the `index.html` file if no file is defined within the URL.

But, Apache can do so much more! You’ll now configure Apache to hand-off certain requests to an application handler - mod_wsgi. The first step in this process is to install mod_wsgi: `sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi`.

You then need to configure Apache to handle requests using the WSGI module. You’ll do this by editing the `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf` file. This file tells Apache how to respond to requests, where to find the files for a particular site and much more. You can read up on everything this file can do within the [Apache documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/configuring.html) .

For now, add the following line at the end of the `<VirtualHost *:80>` block, right before the closing `</VirtualHost>` line: `WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/html/myapp.wsgi`

Finally, restart Apache with the `sudo apache2ctl restart` command.

You might get a warning saying "Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name". If you do, don't worry about it.
