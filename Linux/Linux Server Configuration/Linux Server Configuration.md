You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.

Note: If you have no experience working in the shell we recommend starting with [Linux Command Line Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud595-nd).
 Otherwise, you can jump straight into [Configuring Linux Web Servers](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud299-nd).
